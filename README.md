# SQLMate - Your companion for natural language database querying.

SQL Mate is a natural language interface that allows users to interact with an SQL database without writing queries manually. Powered by a language model, this app dynamically converts user prompts (like "Delete the entry for John" or "Insert a new student with name Alice") into SQL commands, handling SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

Features:
Converts natural language inputs into SQL queries.
Executes SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands.
Displays query results and success messages in an intuitive interface.
No need for manual SQL query writingâ€”just ask in plain English!
Built with Streamlit for the frontend and Google Gemini API for query generation.
